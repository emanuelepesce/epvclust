Title: Optimizazion in C of Hierarchical Clustering with P-Values via Multiscale
	   Bootstrap Resampling
Author: Emanuele Pesce
Maintainer: Emanuele Pesce <emanuelepesce.ep@gmail.it>
Description: An implementation in C of a optmized version of multiscale
             bootstrap resampling for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical
             cluster analysis.
             It provides AU (approximately unbiased) p-value as well as
             BP (bootstrap probability) value for each cluster in a dendrogram.
